# PizzaOrderApp

In this simple project, I use HTML, Javascript as front-end, and ASP.NET web API as the back-end. We both have clent-side and server side validation. In client-side, we use javascript function to validate each field. On the server side, we user c# class library to validate the data received from http post request.
